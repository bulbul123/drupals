The security module bolsters the security of your Drupal site and can cut down on the risk of Cross Site Scripting attacks.

There are 2 modules:

1.  The security module.  This module provides basic security enhancements to your site when configured.
2.  The security experimental module.  This module contains cutting edge security enhancements to Drupal.  Because of its nature, security enhancements
in this module could cause error messages or not with your configuration.  We highly suggest you use it, but you do so at your own risk.

Affiliate Base Extra

Description:
The Extra modules perform tasks that are not safe to include directly in Features code due to the possibility of overwrites.
The Affiliate Base Extra module contains code to set the site front page and 404 page to the content created by the Affiliate Base Feature. It also contains code to create the Language taxonomy (with English and French as terms) and creates default settings for the Apache Solr search functionality.
As a more traditional module, the Affiliate Base Extra creates a footer block with settings for copyright, logo and logo URL (which the Affiliate can use to link the logo to a specific site or page). This block is automatically added to the footer via a Context in the Affiliate Base Feature.
